	<h3><u>Research Highlights</u></h3>
	<p>My research fits within the general goal of improving human individual abilities through developing intelligent systems using design and modelling practices, specifically focused on individual differences in users’ sensorimotor abilities toward technology adoption. Research topics include Computational User Interface Design, Aging & Accessibility, Input and Interaction, and Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</p>
        <p> My past and present research domains are as follows.</p>
	<h4><b><u>Multimodal Text Entry</u></b></h4>
	<p>I developed mechanisms to design text entry interfaces suitable for mouse, finger and eye gaze based interactions in large and small display devices for English and Indic languages. The mechanisms include development of virtual keyboards, word-level prediction method and eye-gaze based text entry interface. I together with my colleagues have made multiple innovations in this area:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>Optimized virtual keyboard layout design in Indic language based on mouse pointer movement distances and conducted experiments with three languages namely Hindi, bengali and Telugu (<a href="/pubs/ijhci2013.pdf" target="_blank">IJHCI 2013</a>)</li>
	        <li>Designed novel touchscreen keyboard layout to accommodate large alphabet set overcoming 'fat finger' problem; the layout also contains character and word=level prediction with werror detection and correction support (ongoing)</li>
		<li>Developed a new set of metrics to evaluate Indic language text entry system (<a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1706/1706.08205.pdf" target="_blank">CHI Workshop 2015</a>) </li>
		<li>Developed a non-expensive hardware for eye tracking and novel dwell-free eye typing interaction for virtual keyboard based English and Hindi text entry (APCHI 2013, India HCI 2013, CHI 2014)</li> 
	</ul>
	<h4><b><u>Computational User Interface Design for Older Adults</u></b></h4>
	<p> I involved in a project of designing novel user interfaces for smartphones that suit to elderly people’s movement capabilities and cognitive functioning. The specific goal was to create scientific foundations for designing user interfaces for smartphones that better suit the individual abilities of older adults. I was part of a team which proposed a new concept called "Ability-based Optimization" which leverages mathematical models of user performance that predict improvements in user interface throughput and functionality. The outcomes are interface designs that improve usability, usefulness, and help older adults avoid expensive and socially stigmatizing specialized devices. </p>
